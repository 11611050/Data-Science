# 👋 Hi, I’m Sai Prakash – Welcome to My Data Science Projects!

Thanks for dropping by my portfolio! This space showcases my passion for finding insights in data, building useful tools, and having a bit of fun along the way. Below are a few projects I really enjoyed working on—each one taught me something new about analytics, code, and the world it describes.

## 📈 Cryptocurrency Market Detective

Ever wondered how Bitcoin and Ethereum keep hogging the spotlight? I did too!  
So I dove into the messy world of cryptocurrency data, wrangling prices and volumes for 400+ coins. With Python, Pandas, and a dash of Power BI, I uncovered what sets the market leaders apart, how trading patterns emerge, and why some coins go wild, while others fade.

**Fun Takeaways:**  
- Built interactive dashboards that make volatile markets easy to explore.
- Created a “crypto leaderboard,” showing why Bitcoin stays on top.
- Found quirks and trends you won’t see at a glance.

## 📚 Library Database: SQL Sleuthing

Behind every busy library are stories in its data—loans, borrowers, branches, and those books nobody touches.  
With SQL superpowers, I mapped out who’s borrowing what, which branches need more attention, and how to track down overdue books (without sending a thousand reminders).

**Why It’s Cool:**  
- Dug up hidden patterns in borrower habits and branch activity.
- Helped libraries rethink inventory and outreach.
- Showed how even simple databases can spark great improvements.

## 🌾 Crop Compatibility: Machine Learning for Farmers

India’s farms feed the world—what if machine learning could help grow even smarter?  
I built a predictive model using Decision Trees, taking soil and weather data to recommend the most promising crops for any location.  
Accuracy? Over 99%. Plus, it helps farmers minimize risk and maximize yield.

**Highlight Moments:**  
- Saw ML genuinely make a difference in agriculture.
- Learned the art (and science) of wrangling diverse datasets.
- Proved that technology and tradition make a great team.
